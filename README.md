# RC-Switch to clone any remote
[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/SorSayyadi/RC-Switch-easily-clone-any-remote.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/SorSayyadi/RC-Switch-easily-clone-any-remote)

Arduino lib to clone and replicate 433/315Mhz devices that are not using standard protocols.

## Wiki
I don't know why everyone make it so hard to explain how to replicate a signal so I created this branch and explained in the following wiki link how to find and replicate the signal.

## Info
### Sending and Receiving RC codes

Use your Arduino or Raspberry Pi to operate remote radio controlled devices.
This will most likely work with all popular low cost power outlet sockets. If
yours doesn't work, you might need to adjust the pulse length.

All you need is a Arduino or Raspberry Pi, a 315/433MHz Transmitter module, a 315/433MHz receiver.
